# Tandemloop Programming Test

This repository contains solutions to the programming test problems.

**Language Used:** Python

## Problems:

### Problem-1: Calculator Class
A class-based calculator performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Output Obtained : 
10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0
10.0 - 5.0 = 5.0
10.0 * 5.0 = 50.0
10.0 / 5.0 = 2.0
10.0 / 0.0 = Error: Division by zero!
Invalid operation example: Error: Invalid operation!

### Problem-2: Odd Number Series (until a = x)
Generates a series of odd numbers up to a certain point based on input 'a'.
Output Obtained :
Input a = 1, then output : 1
Input a = 2, then output : 1, 3
Input a = 3, then output : 1, 3, 5
Input a = 4, then output : 1, 3, 5, 7
Input a = 5, then output : 1, 3, 5, 7, 9

### Problem-3: Odd Number Series (conditional until a = x)
Generates a series of odd numbers based on input 'a', with a slightly different condition than Problem 2.
Input a = 1, then output : 1       
Input a = 2, then output : 1       
Input a = 3, then output : 1, 3, 5 
Input a = 4, then output : 1, 3, 5 
Input a = 5, then output : 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
Input a = 6, then output : 1, 3, 5, 7, 9

### Problem-4: Multiples Count in Dictionary
Counts numbers in a list that are multiples of numbers from 1 to 9. 
Output Obtained : 
Input: [1, 2, 8, 9, 12, 46, 76, 82, 15, 20, 30]
Output: {1: 11, 2: 8, 3: 4, 4: 4, 5: 3, 6: 2, 7: 0, 8: 1, 9: 1}
Input: [7, 14, 21]
Output: {1: 3, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 0, 7: 3, 8: 0, 9: 0}
